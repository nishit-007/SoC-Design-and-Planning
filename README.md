# Digital VLSI SoC Design And Planning

This repository is about the 14 day workshop conducted by VSD-IAT on Physical Design using the open source EDA Tool OpenLANE and open source pdk skywater 130nm.
## Day 1 : Inception of open source EDA , OpenLANE and sky130pdk
**OpenLANE ASIC Design Flow** 

The three compponents of an ASIC are RTL IPs , EDA Tools and PDK Data.

The Process Design Kit (pdk) acts as an interface between the fab and the designers. We used the skywater 130nm pdk. OpenLANE is built around the skywater and is capable of perfoming the RTL2GDS Flow.
